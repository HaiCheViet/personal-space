What seperate between 10x developer and 1x developer, the line have to be really big to satisfy the term 10x developer. Most people think knowlege and experience is what cause the difference but every company have their own problem. The knowlege require between these jobs can be so difference that sometime you have to start from zero. For example mostly stack in Google is build in-house and they really do not care what stack and framework you've learn in the pass. The impactness and productivity of your performance is mostly value and solid metric to compare. But personal productivity always depends on a context and how can someone be 10x productivy than the other even within the same timeframe to solve the task is the same. The question is: do such super-productive professionals even exist, and is it possible to become one of them?
